# CarryMe

CarryMe is a simple and optimized FiveM carry script that supports both **ESX** and **QBCore** frameworks with automatic detection. Designed for immersion, performance, and clean integration.

## Features

- ✅ Synced animations with easy toggle
- ✅ Lightweight and efficient

## Installation
1. Place `CarryMe` in your `resources` folder.
2. Add to your `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure CarryMe
   ```
3. Make sure either `es_extended` or `qb-core` is installed and running.

## Optional
- If using `ox_lib`, notifications will be displayed using the modern UI.
